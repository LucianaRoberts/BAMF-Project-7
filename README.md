Project 1 Thesis

As the longest government shutdown in US history continues, Americans are restructuring their travel plans. National parks are either closed, trashed, or both, museum doors remain shut, and some people have even had to reschedule their weddings.  But the place where perhaps the greatest number of people are feeling the effects of the partial shutdown is at the airport, which is stressful even when functioning at full capacity.

Q: What data is available that might indicate how the government shutdown impacted the airports?

How can we source and visualize flight delay information across the USA, during the period of a government shutdown?
1) increase in number of delayed flights 
2) increase in flight cancellations 
3) length of flight delay
